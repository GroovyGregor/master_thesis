Installation
============

To use scripts of my master thesis, you have to install my 
'MasterModule'. To do so, simply go to 
`MasterModule <http://github.com/GroovyGregor/master_thesis>`_ and 
download the project. There will be an executable file, that you have to
execute. The MasterModule and all its dependencies will then 
automatically be downloaded and installed.

You're ready to go!
