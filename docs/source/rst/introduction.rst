Introduction
============

Welcome to the documentation of my master thesis with the title 'An 
examination of the horizontal rain drift between radar measurement 
height and the ground'. First, let me give you a brief summary what this 
master thesis is about:

Due to radar structure, a radar never measures directly at ground level.
Instead, the measurement height increases, the greater the distance from
the radar site becomes. This means, rain measured by a radar will be 
horizontally drifted before reaching the ground.
The goal of my master thesis is to examine and correct the horizontal 
drift of rain between the radar beam height and the ground or 
between two different radar measurement heights.

The programs to examine this problem are written in 
`python3.5 <https://docs.python.org/3.5>`_.
A description on how to get the programs to work can be found in section
:doc:`installation`.
All scripts are documentated in :doc:`scripts` with an example usage for
each script.
If there is a desire to look more deeply into my code, or even use and
modify some of it: All classes created for this project are documented 
in section :doc:`modules`.
